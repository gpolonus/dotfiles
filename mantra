Today is a new day.

Yesterday is unchangeable.

I cannot change who I was yesterday.

I cannot change who I am this day.

I can do things today that will change who I will be tomorrow.

Today, people will disappoint me.

I will disappoint other people.

Small efforts can make large impacts.

If you lose your job, you will be able to find another one.

Other people will not be able to support you as much as you could support yourself.

You might never find another person to love you.

You might never have children.

You might never get rid of your anxiety.

You might have this same situation with your job at every single job you have.

You might never be truly happy.

You are not the smartest person, and you never will be.

You are not the best person, and you never will be.

You are not the worst person, and you never will be.

You are not the dumbest person, and you never will be.

You won't be able to do everything.

There are a ton of things that you can do.

You can do cool things.

If you want to do cool things, you will have to learn and practice what you learn.

Peace is attainable.
