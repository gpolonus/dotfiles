It's okay to feel this way.

I can have fear, but I need not be my fear if I'm willing to stand somewhere else in my inner landscape.

I am a good person.

I am allowed to make mistakes.

I am enough to accomplish my goals.

I will forgive myself for past mistakes, and I will do better in the future.
